    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lesson, we are going to talk a little more about `self` in object oriented Python (OOP). We have seen a little bit about self when we learned about defining and calling instance methods. What we know so-far is that instance methods implicitly passes in, as its first argument, the instance object on which it was called. We also know that in order for us to execute an instance method, we need to *explicitly* define the instance method with at least one parameter, so that our instance methods can *implicitly* pass in the instance object. By convention, we name this parameter `self` since it is the reference to the object on which we are operating. Let's take a look at some code that uses `self`."

A Person can have an descriptors like `height`, `weight`, `age`, etc. and also have behaviors such as `saying_hello`, `eat_breakfast`, `talk_about_weather`, etc. "
